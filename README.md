# IG stats

> Find and analyze Instagram accounts without needing to login!


IG stats is an Instagram analysis tool that lets you search for users, places and hashtags. The app also lets you view a profile page and the statistics to the profile e.g. followers, followings, posts, and information about the postings.

In the background, the app uses the public Instagram API.

<b> No Instagram account needed </b>

The only downside of this approach is that sometimes if you use the app too much Instagram blocks the request to the API and no data is returned. (Instagram redirects to the login page)
